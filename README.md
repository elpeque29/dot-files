# dot-files

These are my current dot-files (if I remember to keep this repo updated)

In this repo you will find files for

- Alacritty (just changed the background opacity, nothing interesting)
- i3 (from the [EndevourOS Team](https://github.com/endeavouros-team/endeavouros-i3wm-setup) but with some tweaks)
- i3 status
- Neovim
