# Dot Files

These are my current dot-files (if I remember to keep this repo updated)

Some disclaimers:

- My i3 config is from the [EndevourOS Team](https://github.com/endeavouros-team/endeavouros-i3wm-setup) but with some tweaks.
- i3 status is still on there but if you read the i3 config you will notice that I'm currently using i3blocks.
- The neovim config it's just [kickstart](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) but with the kotlin lsp added and a diferent theme, nothing special.

This repo is for my personal use only, but I hope you find something useful.

I do use hyprland from time to time but took the config from here: [HyDE](https://github.com/HyDE-Project/HyDE)
