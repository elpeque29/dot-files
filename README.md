> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some disclaimers:
> - My i3 config is from the [EndevourOS Team](https://github.com/endeavouros-team/endeavouros-i3wm-setup) but with some tweaks.
> - i3 status is still on there but if you read the i3 config you will notice that I'm currently using i3blocks.
> - The neovim config it's just [kickstart](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) but with the kotlin lsp added and a diferent theme, nothing special.
> - For installing the apps I use on a daily basis and the dependencies in order for the configs to work I use [Crucible](https://github.com/typecraft-dev/crucible) from [typecraft](https://github.com/typecraft-dev/) with the some changes.

I do use hyprland from time to time but took the config from here: [HyDE](https://github.com/HyDE-Project/HyDE)
