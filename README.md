# dot-files

These are my current dot-files (if I remember to keep this repo updated)

In this repo you will find files for:

- [Ghostty](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty)
- i3 (from the [EndevourOS Team](https://github.com/endeavouros-team/endeavouros-i3wm-setup) but with some tweaks)
- i3 status
- Neovim (it's [kickstart](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim)(but with the kotlin lsp added and a diferent theme, nothing special)
- [Zed](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed)

And things that wont interest you ... probably. This is for my personal use only, but feel free to take whatever you find useful.
